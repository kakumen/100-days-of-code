# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Learned and built Database schema for the site.

**Thoughts:** Still need to understand how to properly fill in the database records through the site using PHP (namely the Foreign Keys from Intermediate tables)

### Day 2: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Improved site database experimenting filling PK and FK in multiple tabels using $conn->insert_id.
                      Also started working in login system for the site with PHP and prepared statements

**Thoughts:** Still need to understand better $conn->insert_id (and if it was deprecated)
              Need to better understand prepared statements in PHP and why login system is not fully functional
              
### Day 3: March 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Not much progress, still struggling and try to properly understand PHP Prepared statements... I think I find a good blog explaining it, will have a deeper look tomorrow

### March 24, 2020 - Skipped this day, was too tired

### Day 4: March 25, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continued to do the Login system for my website. Getting a better grasp of Prepared Statements in PHP, security against SQL injection and hashing/dehashing passords. But still not fully understanding how it all works...
### Day 5-8: March 26-28, 2020
**Today's Progress** Learning PDO with the great video from @traversymedia and realized I still have many gaps in PHP OOP, so decided to take a break from actual coding and go back to tutorials for a short time, to study this more into detail
**Thoughts:** Objective is to completely understand PHP OOP and complete, together with the PDO, the log in system

### Day 9: March 29, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continued learning PHP OOP with mmtuts youtube channel-MVC Model, inheritance, constructors/destructors, scope, autoloader
**Thoughts:** static methods are access with :: and cannot be accessed if class is instantiated
              still not completly understand how to use MVC Model


### Day 10: March 30, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Still on PHP OOP - built a simple calculator but took me a long time to understand that each file with a class should have the name of that class. Then the autoloader $classname should have also the name of the class file.
Also learned const an static methods
**Thoughts:** autoloader $classname must have the name of the class as it is in the file

### Day 11-12: March 31, April 1st 2020
**Today's Progress**: Tried to do myself a small program to fetch data from a database using PHP PDO and OOP - some success but spend much time struggling to find bugs
**Thoughts:** try again tomorrow to repeat the script
