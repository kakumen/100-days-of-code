# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Learned and built Database schema for the site.

**Thoughts:** Still need to understand how to properly fill in the database records through the site using PHP (namely the Foreign Keys from Intermediate tables)

### Day 2: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Improved site database experimenting filling PK and FK in multiple tabels using $conn->insert_id.
                      Also started working in login system for the site with PHP and prepared statements

**Thoughts:** Still need to understand better $conn->insert_id (and if it was deprecated)
              Need to better understand prepared statements in PHP and why login system is not fully functional
